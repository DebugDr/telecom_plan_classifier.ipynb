# Telecom Plan Classifier 📱

This project aims to help a telecommunications company classify which users are more likely to subscribe to an advanced service plan, based on their usage behavior.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

The goal was to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer would choose the "Ultra" plan or stay on the default plan, based on features such as:

- Number of calls
- Duration of calls (minutes)
- Text messages sent
- Data used (MB)

## 📂 Project Structure


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and explored call/text/data usage.
- **Modeling**: Trained multiple classification models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
- **Evaluation**: Chose the best model based on accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Visualization**: Created intuitive graphs to support conclusions.

## 🎯 Outcome

Achieved a prediction accuracy above **85%**, allowing the company to better identify which customers should be offered a premium telecom plan.
